## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Seth and Tom with gathering
information on an election for the election commission. They needed
to know how to write a script in python that would find out the following.

  1. Find and calculate the total number of votes.
  2. Find the names of all candidates.
  3. Calculate the number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate.
  5. Determine the winner of the election by popular vote.
  6. Find the voter turnout for each county.

produces a text document that outputs the results in a easy to read format.
This script could be further moddified to expand to include the cadidate's
political party, and could be scaled up to include larger lists of data
for state or national elections, if the data is stored in a similar format.
